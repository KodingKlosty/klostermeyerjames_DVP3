### Info ###

Welcome!
This repos is intended for Projects and Portfolios 3 

There will be no outside contribuitons from anyone. 
This is just a one man show, with the occasional monkey thrown in there. 

### Warning ###
I have to let you know I have 4 monkeys that live with me. 
Logan, Tripp, Easton, and Maddox. They have a bad habit of trying to mess with my programs. They have been very effective in the past of uploading some interesting data. Spelling isn't their strong point so there are liable to be many mistakes in a given readme.md update. 

Oh and they often have a pengiun friend that shows up. He never talks but will leave is mark on my code. So beware of the penguins too.
